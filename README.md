# Voxel-Engine-Attempt
A simple Voxel Engine I did to learn Vulkan and try to make my own attempt at volumetric rendering in preparation for the [Cuvel Engine](https://github.com/AsperTheDog/CuvelEngine) project.

Special thanks to [Brendan Galea's Vulkan Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR) for helping me get the Vulkan knowledge I needed
