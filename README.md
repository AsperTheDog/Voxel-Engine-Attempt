# Voxel-Engine-Attempt
A simple Voxel Engine I did to learn Vulkan and try to make my own attempt at volumetric rendering in preparation for the [Cuvel Engine](https://github.com/AsperTheDog/CuvelEngine) project.

Special thanks to [Brendan Galea's Vulkan Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR) for helping me get the Vulkan knowledge I needed

## How to run

It's imperative you have the Vulkan SDK installed as well as glm and glfw. For more information on versions and locations consult the project properties inside Visual Studio
